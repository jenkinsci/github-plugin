    <p>
        Jenkins will use this much space, measured in megabytes,
        in <tt>$JENKINS_HOME</tt> to cache data retrieved from GitHub API calls.
        A cache will help improve the performance by avoiding unnecessary data transfer, and by doing so it also
        makes it less likely to hit <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">API rate limit</a>
        (by the use of <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests">conditional GET</a> calls.)
    </p>
    <p>
        In an unlikely event that cache is causing a problem, set this to <b>0</b> to disable cache altogether.
