<div>
    An optional name to help with the disambiguation of API URLs. If you have multiple GitHub Enterprise servers with non-helpful
    names such as <code>s21356.example.com</code> and <code>s21368.example.com</code> then giving these names can
    help users when they need to select the correct server from a drop-down list. If you do not provide a name,
    then a "best guess" will be made from the hostname part of the API URL.
