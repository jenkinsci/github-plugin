When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, GitHub Plugin checks to see
whether the hook came from a GitHub repository which matches the Git repository defined in SCM/Git section of this job.
If they match and this option is enabled, GitHub Plugin triggers a one-time polling on GITScm.
When GITScm polls GitHub, it finds that there is a change and initiates a build.
The last sentence describes the behavior of Git plugin,
thus the polling and initiating the build is not a part of GitHub plugin.
